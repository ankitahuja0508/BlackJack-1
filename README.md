BlackJack

Android Application - Basic BlackJack card game  

This is a simple black jack card game I started building over my summer vacation. I applied basic Java concepts and topics which I learned in 
high school into learning Android Development. The goal of this application was not to create a fully functional industrial strength Android
application, but to teach myself the basics of Android development over my summer break. In doing so I learnt the basics of Android development, Android's 
activity life cycle, basic XML and a few other Android development related topics.  

Tested Devices: 

	-Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9505G
	-Nexus 7 (First Generation)




*Parts of this code have been lost. I started building this applicaiton before I knew about GIT and GitHub. Unfortunately, this was not intially
backed up under version control when I built it. 



Start of development: July 2013

Latest Update: Feb 19, 2013
